        <h1>OA progression prediction with IMI-APPROACH dataset</h1>
        <br>
        <p> IMI-APPROACH dataset includes 6 sources of data: Biochemical markers <strong>(B)</strong>, Clinical assessments<strong>(C)</strong>, Questionnaires <strong>(Q)</strong>,  MRI <strong>(M)</strong>, Xray <strong>(X)</strong>, Tomography<strong>(T)</strong>. Machine learning models are trained using each data source as well as <strong>all</strong> data combined to predict nine categories of OA progression. </p>
<br>
<h3>Below performance metrics (AUC|F1-score) for all models are listed, please click to see the characteristics selected by each model.</h3>
